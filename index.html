	<h2>Why RentalGeek.com</h2>
		<p class="justifytext"><em>R</em>enting is big business and it's getting even bigger. With today's technology, you have plenty to track and no time for inefficiency. You already know property listing sites like Zillow, Trulia, Hotpads, RadPads and others. They vary in size and goals, but they all endeavor to create value in the rental market in one way or another. Most boast impressive nationwide databases to be sure, but have you ever wondered why their listings seldom offer current, vacant listings? Or wonder why Craigslist still fills more rentals than any other online service? We did, and when we figured it out, it made sense. These sites rely on 3rd party service providers like Appfolio or Property Genie; software that can push listings to their existing online databases without needing to call properties or establish real business relationships. The problem is the final push process is often done without the knowledge of the property manager/owner and the listings most often are not updated when units are eventually leased. The reason why? Because these sites earn a large portion of their revenue from advertising. More listings equals more advertising revenue so often, once a listing is created, it never goes away. At RentalGeek, we believe you deserve better.

<h2>Timely Insight With A Personal Touch</h2>
<div class="subheading">The Rental Application Process</div>
<p><em>O</em>ne of the biggest inefficiencies comes between the search of a property and signing a lease: it takes too long. RentalGeek has developed a novel, scalable process for <a href="#">pre-qualifying tenants</a> - offered to our property management / owner partners. Our pre-qualification process is made up of a standardized, reliable set of metrics that can outline predicative tenant behavior before any documents are signed. Imagine a system that <span class="bluetext">provides a comprehensive picture of each applicant ahead of time</span></p>
<p>you by RentalGeek. Picture how simple the leasing process can be with:</p>

<span class="bluetext">NO PAPER APPLICATIONS</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;
<span class="bluetext">NO CREDIT CHECKS</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;
<span class="bluetext">NO BACKGROUND CHECKS</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;
<span class="bluetext">NO REFERNCE CALLS</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;
<span class="bluetext">NO HASSLES</span>

<p>RentalGeek can help make this a reality for you.</p>
